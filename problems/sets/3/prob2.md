Here is a problem set to help you understand conditional statements, loops, and variables in Java:

1. Functions:
Learn how to wrap your code into function form.

Problem:
- Create a function called calculateTip that takes a double representing the bill amount and an integer representing the tip percentage. Return the tip amount.
- Write a program that takes two floating-point numbers as input and prints their average.

2. Conditional Statements:
Learn how to use if-else and switch statements to make decisions in your code.

Problem:
- Write a program that takes an integer as input and prints "Odd" if the number is odd and "Even" if the number is even.
- Write a program that takes a character as input and prints "Vowel" if the character is a vowel (a, e, i, o, or u) and "Consonant" if the character is a consonant.
- Write a program that takes two integers as input and prints the larger of the two numbers.

3. Loops:
Learn how to use for, while, and do-while loops to repeat sections of code.

Problem: 
- Write a program that prints the sum of the first 10 natural numbers.
- Write a program that takes an integer as input and prints its multiplication table.
- Write a program that takes a string as input and reverses it.

4. Arrays:
Learn how to use arrays to store multiple values of the same data type.

Problem: 
- Write a program that takes an array of integers as input and finds the maximum and minimum values in the array.
- Write a program that takes an array of integers as input and prints the second largest value in the array.
- Write a program that takes an array of strings as input and sorts them in lexicographic order.
- Write a program that takes an array of floating-point numbers as input and calculates the average, minimum, and maximum values.

Final Project:

Put your skills to the test by creating a final project that showcases what you have learned in this problem set.

Problem: Write a program that implements a simple calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. The program should use methods and conditional statements to determine the operation to perform and display the result to the user.
This problem set will help you understand the basics of programming in Java and how to use conditional statements, loops, variables, arrays, and methods. Good luck!
